<h1> About Me </h1>
<p> My name is CJ Cumpay, my student number is s3923816 and my student email address is s3923816@student.rmit.edu.au. I am currently residing at Yenda, New South Wales. The name, CJ, is an abbreviation of Christian James although it is never addressed as formally, I am referred to as CJ. I am the eldest of 4 and I was born in the Philippines. My family and myself migrated to Australia in 2008 for us to have a better quality of life. Although I now consider Australia home, this has not affected me culturally as I still speak the native language of Tagalog and mumâ€™s home cooked meals always provides us a taste of the Philippines.
Having graduated in 2018, I decided to have a 3-year hiatus in education as I was still unsure of what career I want for myself in the future. During those 3 years, I have worked as a retailer at Coles Supermarket, although my current occupation at Coles supports me financially, this was not something I wanted to do throughout my life and ultimately deciding that a career in Information Technology is something that I want since I have always been interested in computers and I always find myself playing with the settings of whatever technological product is in my hand. I have basic knowledge of Information Technology as during High School I studied Multimedia although during High School, admittingly, I was not the most attentive student. The 3 years off education has also given me time to reflect on the time I had while studying and coming to a realisation that education is something to be taken seriously, which is why I chose to enrol at RMIT University in order to study Information Technology.
My favourite hobbies and pastimes include gaming, gym and basketball, although, sports in general is enjoyable for me. I have recently invested in my own fitness and health, unfortunately, the recent Covid-19 lockdown has halted my gym progression, this however, has not demotivated me in living a healthier life as I have implemented simple home workouts during the day. </p>
