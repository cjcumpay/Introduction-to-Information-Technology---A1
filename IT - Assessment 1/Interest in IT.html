<h1 style="font-family: 'brush script mt'; margin-left: 10px;"> Interest in IT </h1>
<p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 20px;"> I have always been interested in IT as the possibilities are essentially endless when it comes to technology due to its expanding nature. This creates a vast number of opportunities for individuals, whether it be in the creative side or a simpler task like a conference call for a group project or a business meeting.
My experience in IT was limited to resources provided by my high school. This, however, did not stop my curiosity as during that time, I took an interest in using multiple resources to express my creative side: I played with video editing software’s like Premiere Pro to create videos involving me and my friends; I ventured into music production using multiple digital audio workstations like Fruity Loops Studio and Serato Studios and I also used with Photoshop to create and edit images for some assignments. Although I couldn’t pursue in enhancing my skills in these software’s further, it was able to provide me some basic knowledge of technology also while giving me an insight in the production of the mentioned mediums which enhanced my appreciation for technology and the power it holds.
</p>
<p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 20px;">I chose to be an RMIT Student as prior to Covid-19 lockdowns I originally planned to move and study in Melbourne to further my education and RMIT University was one of the universities that was in my watchlist, unfortunately, Covid and other factors have made further education not a priority for me at the time. I made the decision of doing an online course as this ensures that I am financially stable while getting the education and ultimately enhance my skills in order to get the career I want in the future.
During my studies in this course I expect to learn about the ins and outs of technology, giving me further insights in how products and apps are created.
